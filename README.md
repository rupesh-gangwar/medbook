There is no key-value pair existed in https://openlibrary.org/search.json API for Books data for the keys:
-> 1. ratings_average
-> 2. ratings_count

So, No functionality for sorting on the basis of average & count is available.

For many Books data the "cover_i" key was also missing, So a placeholder image is placed for those books.
